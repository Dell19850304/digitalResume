                    <p> Perhaps not relevant to the world of tech, but I did a certificate at Ironman University to coach triathletes. Although I am passionate about the world of tech, I am so too about Triathlon ! </p>
                    <p> Here I worked in team format with athletes but also did so individually. Tailor made programs were made for the athletes based on their goals and needs.</p>

                   <p> I was a teacher in Asia from 2015-2019 and I returned to Taiwan in 2022. </p>
                   <p> While teaching English, I have been busy with Software Development studies on fourms such as CodeCademy and Udemy and lastly upon arriving in Taiwan I decided to 
                    join something more official and chose CodeSPace</p>

                <h3> Platform 45 </h3>
            
                    <p>I worked at Platform 45 as an AI Labeller on contract basis to help a team of developers train the AI that they developed.</p>
                    <p>After the AI labelling I did a Rails internship. Although I was learning a lot and moving forward and completed some projects, I was moving to slow due to not knowing Ruby well enough. I needed more time 
                        and hence decided to stop the intership and move over into the software studies at CodeSpace while working in Asia.</p>
                    <p> Platform 45 was a great company to work for. </p>

                    <p>Briefly stated before, I was a triathlon coach. My focus was on helping athletes to develop a good swimming technique.
                        I also helped with the cycling and running of the athletes. We were a team of coaches that had different expertise and we 
                        used these expertise to coach athletes as best we could for different races. Tailor made programs were available on request as well.
